I am currently a postdoc researcher (RA) at Imperial College London in the [Functional Programming group][func-group] working on Scoped Contextual Operations and Effects and Visiting Researcher at University of Kent. 
I was formerly an RA at University of Kent and a Ph.D. student at IT University of Copenhagen.

I am interested in semantics of programming languages, functional programming, recursion schemes, category theory, mathematical logic and type theory.

My Ph.D. thesis was on `Denotational Semantics in Synthetic Guarded Domain Theory`, which can be found [here][phdthesis]
