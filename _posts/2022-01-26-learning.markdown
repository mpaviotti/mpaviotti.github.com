Hello! It is with this post that I intend to start my own blog on all the topics that we all like and adore. Amongst these I hope I will find time to write more about `Recursion Schemes`, `Denotational semantics`, `Category Theory`, `Functional programming` and `Type Theory`. 

I finally decided to spend some time writing down what is inside my head (well, not all of it.. ) with the hope that someone would be interested in it.
Hopefully this will help me to fix some concepts in my head and you to get acquainted with some of what it is commonly referred to as "abstract nonsense". 

I should thank [Nick][nick-wu] for suggesting to start blooogging  and [Hrutvik][hrutvik-kanabar] for helping me with the Jekyll setup which is.. admittedly.. a nightmare!

Enjoy!
