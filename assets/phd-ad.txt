I am looking for a PhD student to work on topics which include, but not limited to, category theory, type theory and functional programming.

The deadline for applications at University of Kent is around January.
You are required to write a research proposal which shows independent thinking and interest in topics related to the ones listed above.

If you're interested be mindful that it may take some time to write a good proposal so reach out to me as early as possible to discuss possible topics of research.

(If you're not sure whether you're going to make a good candidate, you're welcome to drop me a message anyways.)

The university of Kent is walking distance from the charming historic city
of Canterbury, it has a high speed connection to London, and travel to
Europe is convenient by rail or car.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
