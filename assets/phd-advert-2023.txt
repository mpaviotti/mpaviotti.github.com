The Programming Languages and Systems (PLAS) group at the University of Kent's
School of Computing invites applications for 3.5-year PhD scholarships (fully
funded for both UK and international students).

Applications are due by the 5th March 2023.

These scholarships include a doctoral stipend (equivalent to the Research
Councils UK National Minimum Doctoral Stipend, Â£17,668 2022/23 rate, 2023/24 to
be announced), tuition fees and access to further research support funding. If
you are applying as an international candidate, Kent will waive the difference
between Home and International fees.

If you are interested in applying, please contact a potential supervisor (see
list below) as soon as possible, and at least two weeks prior to the closing
date. If the supervisor wishes to support your application, they will direct you
to make an official application through the KentVision system.

Submit your formal applications through the university admission system by the
5th March 2023. Your application should include a completed online admission
form; the name and contact details of two referees; an original document
providing confirmation of your degree (or a transcript if the degree is not yet
awarded). For non-native English speakers, a certificate of competence in
English is required at IELTS 6.5 or higher, with no element less than 6.0 (or
equivalent).
