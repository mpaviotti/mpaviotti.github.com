I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) within the [School of Computing](https://www.kent.ac.uk/computing) at [University of Kent (U.K.)](https://www.kent.ac.uk). 

Previously, I was a Senior Research Associate (senior postdoc) working in the
[Granule Project](https://granule-project.github.io). From 2020 to 2022, I have
been a Research Associate (RA) and Assistant Supervisor at Imperial College
London in the [Functional Programming group](https://fp.doc.ic.ac.uk) and
Visiting Researcher at University of Kent. From 2017 and 2020 I have been an RA
at University of Kent working Weak Memory Concurrency.

I did my Ph.D. at [ITU Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk) (Denmark) in 2016 on
[Denotational Semantics in Synthetic Guarded Domain
Theory](/assets/papers/paviotti-phdthesis.pdf). I also spent six months of my
Ph.D. at Aarhus University within the Logic and Semantics Group. 

I have a M.Sc. with full honors (cum laude) in Theoretical Computer Science and
a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universit√† degli Studi di
Udine](https://www.uniud.it/it) (Italy).

I am interested in **semantics** of programming languages, functional
programming, recursion schemes, **category theory**, mathematical logic and type
theory.

### PhD Vacancies
The school has regular funding for PhD students. The application process goes
via the School of Computing where the applicants are required to write a 10-15
pages Research Proposal. 

If you are interested in doing a PhD in Functional Programming, Type Theory
and/or Category Theory, please send me via email before applying. Your research
proposal should be tailored to my [research topics]({% link research.markdown

- **April 2022:** I will be starting to work in the [Granule Project](https://granule-project.github.io) at University of Kent together with Dr. Dominic Orchard from May 2022.
- **April 2022:** I will be giving a talk in the [Logics and Semantics group](https://cs.ioc.ee/lsg/tsem/) at University Of Tallin on the 26th of May '22 about `bialgebras` and `recursion schemes`.
- **March 2022:** On the 16th of May I will be giving a talk at the [School of Computing](https://www.kent.ac.uk/computing) of University of Kent about `semantics` and `recursion schemes`. Link [here](https://www.kent.ac.uk/events/event/54383/fully-abstract-semantics-with-folds-and-unfolds-marco-paviotti).
- **Jan 2022:** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10287) accepted at [ESOP 22](https://etaps.org/2022/esop) on *Effect handlers for scoped effects* with Z. Yang, N. Wu, B. van den Berg and T. Schrijvers.

### ISO Standards 

Modular Relaxed Dependencies (MRD) is a prospective model of C++ concurrency (first appeared in [ESOP '20'](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-44914-8_22.pdf)) which is being considered for the next ISO standard of C++.
