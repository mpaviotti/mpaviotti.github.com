I am an Assistant Professor (Lecturer) within the [School of
Computing](https://www.kent.ac.uk/computing) at [University of Kent
(U.K.)](https://www.kent.ac.uk). 

Previously, I was a Senior Research Associate (senior postdoc) working in the
[Granule Project](https://granule-project.github.io). From 2020 to 2022, I have
been a Research Associate (RA) and Assistant Supervisor at Imperial College
London in the [Functional Programming group](https://fp.doc.ic.ac.uk) and
Visiting Researcher at University of Kent. From 2017 and 2020 I have been an RA
at University of Kent working Weak Memory Concurrency.

I did my Ph.D. at [ITU Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk) (Denmark) in 2016 on
[Denotational Semantics in Synthetic Guarded Domain
Theory](/assets/papers/paviotti-phdthesis.pdf). I also spent six months of my
Ph.D. at Aarhus University within the Logic and Semantics Group. 

I have a M.Sc. with full honors (cum laude) in Theoretical Computer Science and
a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universit√† degli Studi di
Udine](https://www.uniud.it/it) (Italy).

I am interested in **semantics** of programming languages, functional
programming, recursion schemes, **category theory**, mathematical logic and type
theory.
