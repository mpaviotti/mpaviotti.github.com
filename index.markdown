I am currently a postdoc researcher (RA) at Imperial College London in the [Functional Programming group][func-group] and Visiting Researcher at University of Kent where I was previously an RA.

I did my Ph.D. at ITU Copenhagen in 2016, Denmark, on [Denotational Semantics in Synthetic Guarded Domain Theory][phdthesis]. I also spent six months of my Ph.D. at Aarhus University within the Logic and Semantics Group. 

I am interested in semantics of programming languages, functional programming, recursion schemes, category theory, mathematical logic and type theory.
