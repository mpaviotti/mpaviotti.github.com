#ccc;margin:20px;"> I am Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the [School of Computing](https://www.kent.ac.uk/computing) at [University of Kent (U.K.)](https://www.kent.ac.uk) starting from January 2023. 

Previously, I was a Senior Research Associate
(senior postdoc) working in the [Granule
Project](https://granule-project.github.io). From 2020 to 2022, I have been a Research Associate (RA) and Assistant Supervisor at Imperial College London in the
[Functional Programming group](https://fp.doc.ic.ac.uk) and Visiting Researcher
at University of Kent. From 2017 and 2020 I have been an RA at University of
Kent working Weak Memory Concurrency.

I did my Ph.D. at [ITU Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk) (Denmark) in 2016 on [Denotational Semantics in Synthetic Guarded Domain Theory](/assets/papers/paviotti-phdthesis.pdf). I also spent six months of my Ph.D. at Aarhus University within the Logic and Semantics Group. 

I have a M.Sc. with full honors (cum laude) in Theoretical Computer Science and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universit√† degli Studi di Udine](https://www.uniud.it/it) (Italy).

I am interested in **semantics** of programming languages, functional programming, recursion schemes, **category theory**, mathematical logic and type theory.
