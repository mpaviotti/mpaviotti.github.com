I am currently a postdoc researcher (RA) at Imperial College London in the [Functional Programming group][func-group] and Visiting Researcher at University of Kent where I was previousuly an RA.

I did my Ph.D. at ITU Copenhagen in 2016, Denmark, on [`Denotational Semantics in Synthetic Guarded Domain Theory`][phdthesis]. I also spent six months of my Ph.D. at Aarhus University within the Logic and Semantics Group. 

I am interested in semantics of programming languages, functional programming, recursion schemes, category theory, mathematical logic and type theory. 

At the moment I am investigating the connections between `Recursion schemes` and `Denotational semantics` from a categorical perspective. These theories are being implemented in Haskell.
