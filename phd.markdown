title: Applying for a PhD
---
This page contains a description of my style of Ph.D. supervision, which hopefully will
clarify my expectations and help you judge whether I am a good fit for you and some instructions about how to apply. 

## Getting a PhD
Getting a doctorate could be one of your **biggest life achievements** and the
most amazing time of your life. This, provided you can actually make constant
progress throughout and make it to the end of the line. Otherwise, it can turn
into one of your worst nightmares, a long-winded tunnel in which you cannot see
the light at the end of it. 

A PhD is, in my opinion, a 2-players game and the success of the game is
essentially based on the **relationship** between the two players, the student
and the supervisor. The best scenario possible is when student and supervisor
collaborate with each other the same energy and commitment.

The failure rate for PhD students is typically very high (not everyone gets
to the end of the line successfully) thus it is crucial to find an advisor
whose interests match yours and **a person who you feel comfortable working
with**. 

## My style of supervision
If you want to work with me you need to have a theoretically-inclined mindset. I like the following citation:  

> Computer Science Is Not About Computers, Any More Than Astronomy Is About Telescopes (cit. Edsger W. Dijkstra)

Computer Science is in fact a branch of mathematics that studies the
foundations of computability. It **has little to do with computers**. The fact
that it is has the word "Computer" attached to it is an unfortunate coincidence
(or a cunning marketing device). 

In order to do a PhD with me you have to be interested in (or be willing to
learn) Category Theory, Functional Programming and/or Type Theory. [Here]({%
link research.markdown %}) you can find more information about my research.

If you share my ideas or you would like to learn more about this you are very
welcome to get in touch. 

## The application process
The application process goes via the School of Computing where you are required
to write a mini essay (Research Proposal, 5/6 pages at least) about the research
you wish to conduct under my supervision. One of the purposes of this essay is
to understand what your interests are and if I can be a good supervisor to you.

If you do not know how to write a Research Proposal check this [Youtube
Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5nLdm4Dt-0) out first, then send me the
first draft via email. **Even if it is not perfect**. If I think your topics are
aligned to mine I will help you finalizing it before it gets submitted.  Mind
you, "I will help you finalizing it" means I will help you by guiding you
through it, but **I cannot write it for you**. 

Applications usually open around January and close at the beginning of March, so
keep an eye out. It will take time to write a good proposal so **do not be
late** and **reach out to me earlier** rather than later. 

[Here](/assets/phd-advert-2023.txt)'s the advert for 2023 scholarships. 

In particular, check out [this
page](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/283/computer-science) for info
about what is needed to be eligible (VISAs, English certificate, etc.). Do not
underestimate the need of having this documents ready since universities in the
U.K. tend to be rather strict about requirements even though sometimes they
ought to be flexible. 

Good luck!
