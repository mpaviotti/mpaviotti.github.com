title: So you want to get a PhD ...  
---
If you are here you are probably considering getting a PhD in Theoretical
Computer Science. While a think this is a great idea(!) I would like you to take some time reading this page to make sure you understand the **advantages** as well as the **risks** involved in getting into a PhD program.      

## What is a PhD
A PhD is the highest academic degree awarded by universities which only 2% of
the world's population possesses. When awarded, a PhD is acknowledging that you
possess the skills and knowledge to engage with other international experts in
your field. To earn one, you must demonstrate that you possess a **deep
knowledge** of the field  as well as having made a **significant** and
**original** contribution to your area of study.

It could be one of your **biggest life achievements** and the
most rewarding time of your life. But this is provided you can actually make
constant progress throughout and make it to the end of the line. Otherwise, it
can turn into one of your worst nightmares, a long-winded tunnel in which you
cannot see the light at the end of it. 

A PhD is, in my opinion, a 2-players game and the success of the game is
essentially based on the **relationship** between the two players, the student
and the supervisor. This point deserves more in-depth discussion, but as far as
the _PhD in Europe_ is concerned, I would go as far as saying that the
supervisor is the most important part of your PhD. Thus it is crucial to find an
advisor whose interests match yours and **a person who you feel comfortable
working with**. 

## My Research
It is said (Dovier and Giacobazzi, 2020) that every scientific discipline fully
defines itself when it is framed by a theory that highlights its limits and
potential. For computer science, this happened in the 1930s, during a vibrant
cultural and scientific period that addressed the foundations of mathematics,
physics, and biology, long before the advent of the electronic computer.

Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians
such as Kurt GÃ¶del,  Alan Turing, John von Neumann and Alonzo Church. There
continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas
such as mathematical logic, category theory, domain theory, and algebra. Some,
including myself, consider computer science to have a much closer relationship
with mathematics than many other scientific disciplines. 


> Computer Science Is No More About Computers Than Astronomy Is About Telescopes (cit. Edsger W. Dijkstra)

Computer science should in fact be regarded as a specialized
branch of mathematical logic focused on the principles of computability. The
association with "computers" is, in fact, incidental -- a quirk of terminology
or perhaps a strategic branding choice. 

Category Theory, developed later in the 1940s as part of this foundational
exploration, has since become a crucial framework for understanding and
formalizing the mathematical underpinnings of computer science.

My research focuses in particular, in applications of category theory to
(functional) programming languages, logics and type theories (e.g. Agda). 

If you are interested in any of these topics or would like to learn more, please
feel free to get in touch.


## My Style of Supervision and What you can Expect
As a supervisor, I take a hands-on approach with close guidance when necessary
or allowing you the space to work independently, depending on what you feel most
comfortable with.

It is worth noting that a PhD in Europe typically spans 3 to 4 years, so it is
essential to choose a topic that genuinely interests you and keeps you
motivated, as this will help you maintain steady progress throughout your
journey.

What I am looking for is not someone who knows everything from the outset, but
rather someone with the enthusiasm and capacity to learn new aspects of
mathematics. Independence is also highly valued, and if you are keen to pursue your
own ideas within these areas, I am more than happy to support that.

Regarding flexible working options, I encourage flexibility and use online
meetings when appropriate, but I also encourage students to engage with their
academic environment by being present in the office during working hours. This
is because I believe engaging actively in the research environment not only
fosters creativity and the generation of new ideas but also adds a deeply
fulfilling dimension to the PhD experience.

## The application process
The application process goes via the School of Computing where you are required
to write a mini essay (**Research Proposal**, ~5 pages) about the research you
wish to conduct under my supervision. One of the purposes of this essay is to
understand what your interests are and if I can be a good supervisor to you.

Applications usually open around January and close at the beginning of March, so
keep an eye out. 

In particular, check out [this

about what is needed to be eligible (VISAs, English certificate, etc.).

## Studying in Canterbury

In the latest QS World University Rankings for 2024, the University of Kent has
been ranked in the top 25% of Higher Education Institutions worldwide.

The Kent campus offers breathtaking view of the enchanting historic city of
Canterbury and the cathedral of the Archbishop of Canterbury which forms part of
a World Heritage Site. 

There is an extensive range of housing options within its colleges,
while still maintaining a convenient 30-minute walking distance from the city.
Additionally, should you opt for city living, you have the flexibility to travel
by bike or bus. Canterbury is within a 55m distance from London by train, and
European travel is conveniently within reach via the Eurostar train or by car.

All the best and good luck with your application!
