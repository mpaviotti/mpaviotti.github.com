title: Applying for a PhD
---
This page contains a description of my style of Ph.D. supervision, which hopefully will
clarify my expectations and help you judge whether I am a good fit for you and some instructions about how to apply. 

## Getting a PhD
Getting a doctorate could be one of your **biggest life achievements** and the
most amazing time of your life. This, provided you can actually make constant
progress throughout and make it to the end of the line. Otherwise, it can turn
into one of your worst nightmares, a long-winded tunnel in which you cannot see
the light at the end of it. 

A PhD is, in my opinion, a 2-players game and the success of the game is
essentially based on the **relationship** between the two players, the student
and the supervisor. The best scenario possible is when student and supervisor
collaborate with each other the same energy and commitment.

The failure rate for PhD students is typically very high (not everyone gets
to the end of the line successfully) thus it is crucial to find an advisor
whose interests match yours and **a person who you feel comfortable working
with**. 

## My style of supervision
If you want to work with me you need to have a theoretically-inclined mindset. I
like the following citation: 

> Computer Science Is Not About Computers, Any More Than Astronomy Is About Telescopes (cit. Edsger W. Dijkstra)

Computer Science is in fact a branch of mathematics that studies the foundations
of computability. It **has little to do with computers**. The fact that it is
has the word "Computer" attached to it is an unfortunate coincidence (or a
cunning marketing device). 

Ideally, in order to do a PhD with me you have to be interested in (or be
willing to learn) Category Theory, Functional Programming and/or Type Theory.
[Here]({% link research.markdown %}) you can find more information about my
research.

What I am looking for is not someone who knows everything from the ground up,
but someone who has the emotional awareness and social capacity to work with
other people
and be willing to learn and follow the lead of the supervisor. Independence is also a valuable skill and if you are willing to pursue your own ideas within these topics you are welcome to do so. I will guide you in any way I can, but usually the more you stray away from your supervisor's research topics the less they can be useful for the attainment of your degree.  

Below you can find the list of topics I propose ordered from the most
theoretical ones down to the more practical. Mind you, they all involve category
theory, but category theory can be useful for doing foundational work (e.g. type
theory and topos theory) as well as structuring functional programs (e.g.
optimisation of Haskell programs).

If you like any of these topics or you would like to learn more about this you
are very welcome to get in touch. 

If you do not like any of these topics you are also welcome to propose your own
and I will judge whether these are of interest to me and if I am willing to work
with you. 

Beware, at the end of the day it is crucial that you find a topic that you are
comfortable with and that **makes you tick**. 

## The application process
The application process goes via the School of Computing where you are required
to write a mini essay (Research Proposal, 5/6 pages at least) about the research
you wish to conduct under my supervision. One of the purposes of this essay is
to understand what your interests are and if I can be a good supervisor to you.

If you do not know how to write a Research Proposal check this [Youtube
Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5nLdm4Dt-0) out first, then send me the
first draft via email. **Even if it is not perfect**. If I think your topics are
aligned to mine I will help you finalizing it before it gets submitted.  Mind
you, "I will help you finalizing it" means I will help you by guiding you
through it, but **I cannot write it for you**. 

Applications usually open around January and close at the beginning of March, so
keep an eye out. It will take time to write a good proposal so **do not be
late** and **reach out to me earlier** rather than later. 

[Here](/assets/phd-advert-2023.txt)'s the advert for 2023 scholarships. 

In particular, check out [this
page](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/283/computer-science) for info
about what is needed to be eligible (VISAs, English certificate, etc.). Do not
underestimate the need of having this documents ready since universities in the
U.K. tend to be rather strict about requirements even though sometimes they
ought to be flexible. 

## Studying in Canterbury

In the latest QS World University Rankings for 2024, the University of Kent has
been ranked in the top 25% of Higher Education Institutions worldwide.

Nestled atop a picturesque hill, the Kent campus offers breathtaking view of the
enchanting historic city of Canterbury and the cathedral of the Archbishop of
Canterbury which forms part of a World Heritage Site. 

The campus provides an extensive range of housing options within its colleges,
while still maintaining a convenient 30-minute walking distance from the city.
Additionally, should you opt for city living, you have the flexibility to travel
by bike or bus. With a high-speed connection to London, the City is just a 55m
ride away by train, and European travel is conveniently within reach via the
Eurostar train or by car.

Good luck!
