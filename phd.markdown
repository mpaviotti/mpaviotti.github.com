title: PhD Advising Statement
---
This is a description of my style of Ph.D. supervision, which hopefully will
clarify my expectations and help you judge whether I am a good fit for you.

Let's start with something basic yet **very important**.

Getting a doctorate could be one of your **biggest life achievements** and the
most amazing time of your life. This, provided you can actually make constant
progress throughout and make it to the end of the line. Otherwise, it can turn
into one of your worst nightmares, a long-winded tunnel in which you cannot see
the light at the end of it. 

A PhD is, in my opinion, a 2-players game and the success of the game is
essentially based on the **relationship** between the two players, the student
and the supervisor. The best scenario possible is when student and supervisor
collaborate with each other the same energy and commitment.

As a supervisor I am committed to supervise students and to do my best to ensure
their research progresses in a constant and timely manner, but rest assured that
there is **is a lot of work up ahead** and you will need to focus if you want to get through it.   

The failure rate for PhD students is typically very high (not everyone gets
to the end of the line successfully) thus it is **crucial** to find an advisor
whose interests match yours and **a person who you feel comfortable working
with**. 

In particular, if you want to work with me you need to have a theoretically-inclined mindset. I like the following citation:  

> Computer Science Is Not About Computers, Any More Than Astronomy Is About Telescopes (cit. Edsger W. Dijkstra)

**Computer Science** is in fact a branch of mathematics that studies the
foundations of computability. It **has nothing to do with computers**. The fact
that it is has the word "Computer" attached to it is an unfortunate coincidence
(or a cunning marketing device). In order to do a PhD with me you have to love
passionately (or be willing to learn) Category Theory, Functional Programming
and/or Type Theory. [Here]({% link research.markdown %}) you can find more
information about my research.

If you do not like what I just said above you should not apply for a PhD with
me. You will be able to find plenty of more practical computer scientists whom
will not agree with my views.

On the other hand, if you share my ideas or you would like to learn more about
this you are very welcome to get in touch. 

The application process goes via the School of Computing where you are required
to write a mini essay (Research Proposal, 5/6 pages at least) about the research
you wish to conduct under my supervision. One of the purposes of this essay is
to understand what your interests are and if I can be a good supervisor to you.
It is also designed to assess whether you 
have the right amount of motivations to embark in this journey.    

If you do not know how to write a Research Proposal check this [Youtube
Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5nLdm4Dt-0) out first, then send me the
first draft via email. **Even if it is not perfect**. If I think your topics are
aligned to mine I will help you finalizing it before it gets submitted.  Mind
you, "I will help you finalizing it" means I will help you by guiding you
through it, but **I cannot write it for you** for the reasons I stated above. 

Applications usually open around January and close at the beginning of March, so
keep an eye out. It will take time to write a good proposal so **do not be
late** and **reach out to me earlier** rather than later. 

[Here](/assets/phd-advert-2023.txt)'s the advert for 2023 scholarships. 

In particular, check out [this
page](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/283/computer-science) for info
about what is needed to be eligible (VISAs, English certificate, etc.). Do not
underestimate the need of having this documents ready since universities in the
U.K. tend to be rather strict about requirements even though sometimes they
ought to be flexible. 

Good luck!
