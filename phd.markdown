title: So you want to get a PhD ...  
---
If you are here you are probably considering getting a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science. 
While a think this is a great idea(!) I would like you to take some time reading this page to make sure you understand the **advantages** as well as the **risks** involved in getting into a PhD program.      

## What is a PhD
A PhD is the highest academic degree awarded by universities acknowledging that
you possess the skills and knowledge to engage with other international experts
in your field. To earn a PhD, you must demonstrate that you possess a **deep
knowledge** of the field  as well as having made a **significant** and
**original** contribution to your area of study.

It could be one of your **biggest life achievements** and the
most rewarding time of your life. But this is provided you can actually make
constant progress throughout and make it to the end of the line. Otherwise, it
can turn into one of your worst nightmares, a long-winded tunnel in which you
cannot see the light at the end of it. 

A PhD is, in my opinion, a 2-players game and the success of the game is
essentially based on the **relationship** between the two players, the student
and the supervisor. This point deserves more in-depth discussion, but as far as
the PhD in Europe is concerned, I would go as far as saying that the supervisor
is the most important part of your PhD.

The failure rate for PhD students is typically very high. I have run some
calculations based on my own personal experience and the numbers tell me the
**failure rate** can be in certain institutions **as high as 50%**. Thus it is
crucial to find an advisor whose interests match yours and **a person who you
feel comfortable working with**. 

## My Research
It is said (Dovier and Giacobazzi, 2020) that every scientific discipline fully defines itself when it is framed by a theory that highlights its limits and potential. For computer science, this happened in the 1930s, during a vibrant cultural and scientific period that addressed the
foundations of mathematics, physics, and biology, long before the advent of the
electronic computer.

Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians
such as Kurt GÃ¶del,  Alan Turing, John von Neumann and Alonzo Church. There
continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas
such as mathematical logic, category theory, domain theory, and algebra. Some,
including myself, consider computer science to have a much closer relationship
with mathematics than many other scientific disciplines, with some saying that 

> Computer Science is the Foundation of Mathematics (cit. Bob Harper)

Computer Science is, in fact, a branch of mathematics which studies the
foundations of computability. It has little to do with computers. The fact that
it has the word "Computer" attached to it is an unfortunate coincidence (or a
cunning marketing device). Hence the following citation:

> Computer Science Is No More About Computers Than Astronomy Is About Telescopes (cit. Edsger W. Dijkstra)

Category Theory, developed later in the 1940s as part of this foundational
exploration, has since become a crucial framework for understanding and
formalizing the mathematical underpinnings of computer science.

My research focuses in particular, in applications of category theory to (functional) programming languages, logics and type theories (e.g. Agda). 

If you are interested in any of these topics or would like to learn more, please
feel free to get in touch.


## My Style of Supervision and What you can Expect
As a hands-on supervisor, I am flexible in my approach. I can provide close
supervision if needed or give you the autonomy to work independently, depending
on your preference.

It is, however, important to understand that a PhD (in Europe) lasts for 3/4
years, therefore it is crucial that you find a topic that you are comfortable
with and that **makes you tick** so that you can make constant progress.

What I am looking for is not someone who knows everything from the ground up,
but someone who possesses the **ability and willingness to learn** new bits of
mathematics and the **emotional intelligence**, **awareness** and **social
capacity** to work with other people as well as being willing follow the lead of
the supervisor. **Independence** is also a valuable skill and if you are willing
to pursue your own ideas within these topics you are welcome to do so.

On flexible working options. Over the the past few years,
we've discovered that remote work brings valuable flexibility and supports a
more sustainable lifestyle by avoiding unnecessary travel. Nevertheless, as we
strive to maintain flexibility and adopt online meetings when suitable, I'd like
to emphasize the significance of **being physically present at the office**
during working hours. This is because active engagement in the daily research
environment not only **nurtures creativity** and **sparks new ideas**, but also
plays a significant and fulfilling role in the pursuit of a PhD.

## The application process
The application process goes via the School of Computing where you are required
to write a mini essay (**Research Proposal**, ~5 pages) about the research
you wish to conduct under my supervision. One of the purposes of this essay is
to understand what your interests are and if I can be a good supervisor to you.

If you do not know how to write a Research Proposal check this [Youtube
Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5nLdm4Dt-0) out first, then send me the
first draft via email. **Even if it is not perfect**. If I think your topics are
aligned to mine I will help you finalizing it before it gets submitted.  Mind
you, "I will help you finalizing it" means I will help you by guiding you
through it, but **I cannot write it for you**. 

Applications usually open around January and close at the beginning of March, so
keep an eye out. It will take time to write a good proposal so **do not be
late** and **reach out to me earlier** rather than later. 

In particular, check out [this
page](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/283/computer-science) for info
about what is needed to be eligible (VISAs, English certificate, etc.). Do not
underestimate the need of having this documents ready since universities in the
U.K. tend to be rather strict about requirements even though sometimes they
ought to be flexible. 

## Studying in Canterbury

In the latest QS World University Rankings for 2024, the University of Kent has
been ranked in the top 25% of Higher Education Institutions worldwide.

Nestled atop a picturesque hill, the Kent campus offers breathtaking view of the
enchanting historic city of Canterbury and the cathedral of the Archbishop of
Canterbury which forms part of a World Heritage Site. 

The campus provides an extensive range of housing options within its colleges,
while still maintaining a convenient 30-minute walking distance from the city.
Additionally, should you opt for city living, you have the flexibility to travel
by bike or bus. With a high-speed connection to London, the City is just a 55m
ride away by train, and European travel is conveniently within reach via the
Eurostar train or by car.

All the best and good luck with your application!
