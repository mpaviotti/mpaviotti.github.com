title: PhD Advising Statement
---
This is a description of my style of Ph.D. supervision, which hopefully will
clarify my expectations and helps you judge whether I am a good fit for you.

Let's start with something basic yet **very important**.

> The success of your PhD depends almost entirely on the relationship between you and your supervisor. 

Getting a doctorate could be one of your biggest life achievements, provided you
can make it to the end of the line, in which case it can turn into one of your
worst nightmares. The failure rate for a PhD student is typically very high and this is because a high rate of 
PhD students do not understand the rules of the game before they get into it.    

A PhD is typically 3/4 years of work in one single topic and it is a rather
serious commitment so it is **crucial** to find an advisor whose interests match
yours and a person who you feel comfortable working with. 

To be a good match to me you need to have a theoretically-inclined mindset. It is said that 

> Computer Science Is Not About Computers, Any More Than Astronomy Is About Telescopes (cit. Edsger W. Dijkstra)

**Computer Science** is in fact a branch of mathematics that studies the foundations of computability. It **has nothing to do with computers**. The fact that it is has the word "Computer" attached to is an unfortunate coincidence (or a clumsy marketing device).
[Here]({% link research.markdown %}) you can find more information about this, but for the time being let me say that in order to do a PhD with me you have
to love passionately (not just like) Category Theory, Functional Programming and/or Type Theory.

If you do not like what I just said above you should not apply for a PhD with me. 

On the other hand, if you share my ideas or you would like to learn more about this you are very welcome to get in touch. 

The application process goes via the School of Computing where you are required
to write a mini essay (Research Proposal, 3/4 pages at least). The only purpose of this essay is to understand what your 
interests are and if I can be a good supervisor to you. It is not a test! 
You should be true to yourself and write down a small piece of text about the things that make you tick. 

If you do not know how to write a Research Proposal check this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5nLdm4Dt-0) out. 

Good luck!
